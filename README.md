# StoryTime
This repository is for the Alexa app, StoryTime. StoryTime is, essentially, a knock-off of madlibs. The general way it will work is it will choose a random template from its library, go through a map of [types of words, saved words], prompting the type of word, and saving the provided, spoken word. If necessary, it will confirm the word with the user. The app will proceed through the entire map, and at the end, will recite the entire story with the saved words.

Things that would be nice to add:
-Collection of types of stories: Sci-fi, Fantasy, Political, Shakespeare, etc.
-Allow alexa to save a story that you liked
-Allow the user to select a specific story, which would require templates to have titles
-Have a "family friendly" filter
